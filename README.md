# PedView & nuScenes-collision
## Introduction
PedView is a pedestrian collision predicting system that incorporates both pedestrian location and intent using a 3D detector and fuzzy rules.
Monocular 3D pedestrian detection based on FCOS3D.
To evaluate the pedestrian collision prediction, we carefully selected 456 forward-looking images from the nuScenes validation set to construct a pedestrian collision prediction dataset, namely nuScenes-collision. This dataset encompasses various scenarios, including pedestrians crossing crosswalks, crossing roads, and pedestrians walking/standing around cars.
